# ðŸ“¦ Login & Verification Feature
This app includes a basic login system using phone numbers. When a user enters their phone number, the server sends back a 6-digit code (just like in real apps). The user can then enter that code to complete the login.

All user data is saved in a simple users.json file â€” no database needed for now.
Itâ€™s perfect for testing, small apps, or learning how backend systems work.
